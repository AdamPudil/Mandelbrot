# Mandelbrot

## Goal of project

I know tasks like that are best task for GPU, not CPU.
But I'm not looking to write fastest mandelbrot so it realy doesn't matter for me.
For me it's cool way to learn some optimalizations. First version is just basic implementation with threads. 

## Version performance

for now it will be just default pose and fps set to unlimited at 
- resolution: 1280x720
- max iterations: 400
- threads - 12 (and one just for measure)

V 1.0: 74 FPS (One thread: 8.2 FPS)
